The classification of music by genre is a common problem with current applications, for instance recommendation engines used by companies like Spotify and Pandora. The inherently subjective nature of music makes systematic description and classification difficult. In the past machine classifications were made according to song metadata (Artist, label, etc.), but it is increasingly possible to achieve this using the audio data themselves.
