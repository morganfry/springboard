Springboard Capstone Project 1
Histoplathologic Cancer Detection
May 2020

Histopathologic cancer detection is the identification of cancer cells in tissue samples. In brief, tissue is stained with a contrast dye that reacts with cancerous cells and then are visually identified under a microscope. If machine image classification can improve on the performance of humans in this regard, it can lead to better patient outcomes by detecting cancer more accurately and earlier.
	The data for this project is a subset of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset, assembled for the Kaggle competition Histopathologic Cancer Detection. It is a set of images of lymph node sections, with binary labels indicating the presence of metastatic tissue.  The PCam set contains some duplicate images to balance the numbers of positive and negative samples. The Kaggle set used here has the duplicates removed so as to deal with the original data.
	Using some simple classification algorithms implemented in Python using the Scikit-Learn package, I was able to achieve about a 70% accuracy in classifying these images.
